Hellow my friend Federico Marotta
----------------------------------

I use TexWorks (the latest version) as Latex Editor.
Basically, I compile with Xelatex.

I'm a beginner at latex, so I don't know the details yet.

So, I compress the folder as a whole and attach it.

Just in case, go to the folder where the file is saved and on the doc shell,
When I run it, how do I solve the following compilation errors?
