\section{Headings}

So far, in this document I used two different styles for the chapter
headings: one has the chapter name, a rule and, in the margin, the
chapter number; the other has an image at the top of the page, and
the chapter title is printed in a box (like for this chapter). There
is one additional style, which I used only in the \nrefch{appendix};
there, the chapter title is enclosed in two horizontal rules, and
the chapter number (or letter, in the case of the appendix) is above
it.\sidenote[][.7cm]{To be honest, I do not think that mixing heading
styles like this is a wise choice, but in this document I did it only to
show you how they look.}

Every book is unique, so it makes sense to have different styles from 
which to choose. Actually, it would be awesome if whenever a 
\Class{kao}-user designs a new heading style, he or she added it to the 
three styles already present, so that it will be available for new users 
and new books.

The choice of the style is made simple by the \Command{setchapterstyle} 
command. It accepts one option, the name of the style, which can be: 
\enquote{plain}, \enquote{kao}, \enquote{bar}, or 
\enquote{lines}.\sidenote{Plain is the default \LaTeX\xspace title 
style; the other ones are self explanatory.} If instead you want the 
image style, you have to use the command \Command{setchapterimage}, 
which accepts the path to the image as argument; you can also provide an 
optional parameter in square brackets to specify the height of the 
image. \Command{setchapterimage} automatically sets the chapter style to 
\enquote{bar} for that chapter (and also for subsequent chapters).

Let us make some examples. In this book, I begin a normal chapter with 
the lines:
\begin{lstlisting}
\setchapterstyle{kao}
\setchapterpreamble[u]{\margintoc}
\chapter{Title of the Chapter}
\labch{title}
\end{lstlisting}

In Line 1 I choose the style for the title to be \enquote{kao}. Then, I 
specify that I want the margin toc. The rest is ordinary administration 
in \LaTeX, except that I use my own \Command{labch} to label the 
chapter. Actually, the \Command{setchapterpreamble} is a standard 
\KOMAScript\xspace one, so I invite you to read about it in the KOMA
documentation. Once the chapter style is set, it holds until you change 
it.\sidenote{The \Command{margintoc} has to be specified at every 
chapter. Perhaps in the future this may change; it all depends on how 
this feature will be welcomed by the users, so keep in touch with me if 
you have preferences!} Whenever I want to start a chapter with an image, 
I simply write:

\begin{lstlisting}
\setchapterimage[7cm]{path/to/image.png} % Optionally specify the height
\setchapterpreamble[u]{\margintoc}
\chapter{Catchy Title} % No need to set a chapter style
\labch{catchy}
\end{lstlisting}

If you prefer, you can also specify the style at the beginning of the 
main document, and that style will hold until you change it again.

\section{Headers \& Footers}

Headers and footers in \KOMAScript\xspace are handled by the 
\Package{scrlayer-scrpage} package. There are two basic style: 
\enquote{scrheadings} and \enquote{plain.scrheadings}. The former is 
used for normal pages, whereas the latter is used in title pages (those 
where a new chapter starts, for instance) and, at least in this book, in 
the front matter. At any rate, the style can be changed with the 
\Command{pagestyle} command, \eg 
\lstinline|\pagestyle{plain.scrheadings}|.

In both styles, the footer is completely empty. In plain.scrheadings,
also the header is absent (otherwise it wouldn't be so plain\ldots), but 
in the normal style the design is reminiscent of the \enquote{kao} style
for chapter titles.

\section{\Option{twoside} mode}

\begin{kaobox}[frametitle=To Do]
The \Option{twoside} class option is still unstable and may lead to 
unexpected behaviours. Great strides have been done since the first 
version of \Class{kaobook}, but some work still needs to be done. As 
always, any help will be greatly appreciated.
\end{kaobox}

By passing the \Option{twoside} option to the \Class{kaobook}, the
style of left and right pages will be different, similarly to a
printed book. In digital books, having a symmetrical layout for
left and right pages is less important, and you may be tempted
to use the \Option{twoside=false} option. However, keep in mind
that in \enquote{oneside} mode the \Command{uppertitleback} and
\Command{lowertitleback} commands are not available.\sidenote{Another
useful thing to keep in mind is that, when \Option{twoside=true}, an
extra white page will be added to the frontmatter.} If you want to have 
the upper/lower titleback in a one-side document, just add manually the 
contents that you'd put using the upper/lower titleback commands.

\section{Table of Contents}

Another important part of a book is the table of contents. By default, 
in \Class{kaobook} there is an entry for everything: list of figures, 
list of tables, bibliographies, and even the table of contents itself. 
Not everybody might like this, so we will provide a description of the 
changes you need to do in order to enable or disable each of these 
entries. In the following \reftab{tocentries}, each item corresponds to 
a possible entry in the \acrshort{tocLabel}, and its description is the 
command you need to provide to have such entry. These commands are 
specified in the attached \href{style/style.sty}{style 
package},\sidenote{In the same file, you can also choose the titles of 
these entries.} so if you don't want the entries, just comment the 
corresponding lines.

Of course, some packages, like those for glossaries and indices, will 
try to add their own entries.\marginnote{In a later section, we will see 
how you can define your own floating environment, and endow it with an 
entry in the \acrshort{tocLabel}.} In such cases, you have to follow the 
instructions specific to that package. Here, since we have talked about 
glossaries and notations in \refch{references}, we will briefly see how
to configure them.

\begin{table}
\footnotesize
\caption{Commands to add a particular entry to the table of contents.}
\labtab{tocentries}
\begin{tabular}{ l@{\hspace{1mm}}l }
	\toprule
	Entry & Command to Activate \\
	\midrule
	Table of Contents & \lstinline|\setuptoc{toc}{totoc}| \\
    List of Figs/Tabs & \lstinline|\PassOptionsToClass{toc=listof}{\@baseclass}| \\
	Bibliography & \lstinline|\PassOptionsToClass{toc=bibliography}{\@baseclass}| \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For the \Package{glossaries} package, use the \enquote{toc} option when 
you load it: \lstinline|\usepackage[toc]{glossaries}|. For 
\Package{nomencl}, pass the \enquote{intoc} option at the moment of 
loading the package. Both \Package{glossaries} and \Package{nomencl} are 
loaded in the attached \href{style/packages.sty}{\enquote{packages} 
package}.

Additional configuration of the table of contents can be performed 
through the packages \Package{etoc}, which is loaded because it is 
needed for the margintocs, or the more traditional \Package{tocbase}. 
Read the respective documentations if you want to be able to change the 
default \acrshort{tocLabel} style.\sidenote[][*-1]{(And please, send me 
a copy of what you have done, I'm so curious!)}

\section{Paper Size}

Recent versions of Kaobook support paper sizes different from the
default A4. It is possible to pass the name of the paper as an option
to the class, as we are accustomed for any other \LaTeX\ class. For
example, the class option \Option{b5paper} would set the paper size
to the B5 format.

We also support the paper sizes specified in
\href{https://www.bod.de/hilfe/hilfe-und-service.html?cmd=SINGLE\&entryID=2494\_GER\_WSS\&eo=2\&title=welche-buchformate-gibt-es}{this
web page} and some additional sizes requested by the users, with the 
option names specified in \reftab{papersizes}.

\begin{margintable}[*-6]
	\caption{Some non-standard paper sizes supported by kaobook.}
	\labtab{papersizes}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		\toprule
		Dimension & Option name \\
		\midrule
		12.0cm x 19.0cm & smallpocketpaper \\
		13.5cm x 21.5cm & pocketpaper \\
		14.8cm x 21.0cm & a5paper \\
		15.5cm x 22.0cm & juvenilepaper \\
		17.0cm x 17.0cm & smallphotopaper \\
		21.0cm x 15.0cm & appendixpaper \\
		17.0cm x 22.0cm & cookpaper \\
		19.0cm x 27.0cm & illustratedpaper \\
		17.0cm x 17.0cm & photopaper \\
		16.0cm x 24.0cm & f24paper \\
		%21.0cm x 29.7cm & a4paper \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{margintable}

For instance, to use the \enquote{smallpocketpaper} add the correct 
description at the beginning of the documentclass instruction:
\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass[
		smallpocketpaper,
		fontsize=10pt,
		twoside=false,
		%open=any,
		secnumdepth=1,
]{kaobook}
\end{lstlisting}

Sometimes it is convenient to adopt a landscape view; \Class{kaobook} 
provides two additional options, \Option{a4paperlandscape} and 
\Option{169paperlandscape}, which set the page in landscape mode with 
width-to-height ratios of, respectively, 1.414 and 16:9.

\section{Page Layout}

Besides the page style, you can also change the width of the content of 
a page. This is particularly useful for pages dedicated to part titles, 
where having the 1.5-column layout might be a little awkward, or for 
pages where you only put figures, where it is important to exploit all 
the available space.

In practice, there are two layouts: \enquote{wide} and \enquote{margin}. 
The former suppresses the margins and allocates the full page for 
contents, while the latter is the layout used in most of the pages of 
this book, including this one. The wide layout is also used 
automatically in the front and back matters.

\marginnote{Sometimes it is desirable to increase the width for just one 
or a few paragraphs; the \Environment{widepar} environment does that: 
wrap your paragraphs in this environment, and they will occupy the full 
width of the page.}

To change page layout, use the \Command{pagelayout} command. For 
example, when I start a new part, I write:

\begin{lstlisting}
\pagelayout{wide}
\addpart{Title of the New Part}
\pagelayout{margin}
\end{lstlisting}

Beyond these two basic layouts, it is also possible to finely tune the 
page layout by redefining the \Command{marginlayout} command. This 
command is called internally by the higher-level \Command{pagelayout}, 
and it is responsible for setting the width of the margins and of the 
text. The default definition is:

\begin{lstlisting}
\newcommand{\marginlayout}{%
	\newgeometry{
		top=27.4mm,				% height of the top margin
		bottom=27.4mm,			% height of the bottom margin
		inner=24.8mm,			% width of the inner margin
		textwidth=107mm,		% width of the text
		marginparsep=8.2mm,		% width between text and margin
		marginparwidth=49.4mm,	% width of the margin
	}%
}
\end{lstlisting}

so if you want to, say, decrease the width of the margin while 
increasing the width of the text, you could write in the preamble of 
your document something like:

\begin{lstlisting}
\renewcommand{\marginlayout}{%
	\newgeometry{
		top=27.4mm,				% height of the top margin
		bottom=27.4mm,			% height of the bottom margin
		inner=24.8mm,			% width of the inner margin
		textwidth=117mm,		% width of the text
		marginparsep=8.2mm,		% width between text and margin
		marginparwidth=39.4mm,	% width of the margin
	}%
}
\end{lstlisting}

where the text width has been increased by 10mm and the margin width has 
been decreased by 10mm.

\section{Numbers \& Counters}

In this short section we shall see how dispositions, sidenotes and 
figures are numbered in the \Class{kaobook} class.

By default, dispositions are numbered up to the section in \Class{kaobook}
and up to the subsection in \Class{kaohandt}. This can be changed by
passing the option \Option{secnumdepth} to\Class{kaobook} or
\Class{kaohandt} (e.g. 1 corresponds to section and 2 corresponds to
subsections).

The sidenotes counter is the same across all the document, but if you 
want it to reset at each chapter, just uncomment the line

\begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
\counterwithin*{sidenote}{chapter}
\end{lstlisting}

in the \Package{styles/style.sty} package provided by this class.

Figure and Table numbering is also per-chapter; to change that, use 
something like:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
\renewcommand{\thefigure}{\arabic{section}.\arabic{figure}}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{White Space}

One of the things that I find most hard in \LaTeX\xspace is to finely 
tune the white space around objects. There are not fixed rules, each 
object needs its own adjustment. Here we shall see how some spaces are 
defined at the moment in this class.\marginnote{Attention! This section 
may be incomplete.}

\textbf{Space around sidenotes and citations marks}

There should be no space before or after sidenotes and citation marks, 
like so:

sidenote\sidenote{This paragraph can be used to diagnose any problems:
if you see whitespace around sidenotes or citation marks, probably
a \% sign is missing somewhere in the definitions of the class
macros.}sidenote\newline
citation\cite{James2013}citation

\textbf{Space around figures and tables}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
\renewcommand\FBaskip{.4\topskip}
\renewcommand\FBbskip{\FBaskip}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Space around captions}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
\captionsetup{
	aboveskip=6pt,
	belowskip=6pt
}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Space around displays (\eg equations)}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=kaolstplain]
\setlength\abovedisplayskip{6pt plus 2pt minus 4pt}
\setlength\belowdisplayskip{6pt plus 2pt minus 4pt}
\abovedisplayskip 10\p@ \@plus2\p@ \@minus5\p@
\abovedisplayshortskip \z@ \@plus3\p@
\belowdisplayskip \abovedisplayskip
\belowdisplayshortskip 6\p@ \@plus3\p@ \@minus3\p@
\end{lstlisting}
